# PyDAO
This Soft9000/PyDAO project allows us to quickly create a Python Class from either a GUI, API, textual (CSV, TDF, Enpiped, etc.) data file, or using a Python Dictionary. 

Workflows include (1) creating stand-alone data projects, (2) extracting data projects from textual (CSV, etc.) data files, (3) creating database code from code projects, and (4) directly creating code from textual data files.

The generated code can be used to create / drop database schema (DDL,) as well as to import & work with (C.R.U.D & query) your designed / detected / updated code projects.


MAIN.py (Release Testing)
-------
2018/12/31: The GUI is working well enough to declare what we have as an Alpha. Feel free to give it a try!
If you want to support the effort, then purchase one of our training opportunuties, below.

PyDAO UI: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/main.py


API Example
------------
For those who would rather create the DAO directly, without using a data file:

Fast-Schema Example: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/Demo123.py


DATA EXAMPLE + TEST CASE
------------------------
Includes a classic "address book" example as a test case:

Data Example: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/tc001_data.txt

Generated Code: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/foo.py


STOCK MARKET
------------
Python 1000, Python 2000, and Python 3000 students who are participating in our Stock Market resume-builder will want 
to look at the NASDAQ database generator.

Selecting Data: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/GenNasdaqTest.py

While that stock exchange's official pipe-delimited ("enpiped" ;) data file is incuded for demonstrative
purposes, note that the most recent set of enpiped data tokens can be downloaded from the stock exchange.
