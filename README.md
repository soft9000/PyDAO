# PyDAO
The Soft9000/PyDAO ("PyDAO") project allows us to quickly create a Python Class from either a GUI, API, textual (CSV, TDF, Enpiped, etc.) data file, or using a Python Dictionary. 

![PyDAO Project Logo](https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/PyDAO_GitLogo.png]

_Workflows include_: 

(1) creating stand-alone PyDAO projects, 

(2) extracting PyDAO projects from textual (CSV, etc.) data files, 

(3) creating database code from PyDAO projects, and 

(4) directly creating code from the PYDAO API. Result output-locations can also be specified.

The generated code can be used to create / drop database schema (DDL,) as well as to import & work with (C.R.U.D & query) your designed / detected / updated projects.

MAIN.py (Release Testing)
-------
2021/02/18: Have been using row factories for awhile now. Decided to share. We also can now .insert + .update our DAO's 'object.fields' data, as well.

2018/12/31: The GUI is working well enough to declare what we have as an Alpha. All four (4) workflows are supported - feel free to give it a try!

If you want to support the effort, then purchase one of [our books on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Randall-Nagy/e/B08ZJLH1VN) or [training opportunuties](https://www.udemy.com/user/randallnagy2/).

API Example
------------
For those who would rather create the DAO directly, without using a data file:

DATA EXAMPLE + TEST CASE
------------------------
Includes a classic "address book" example as a test case:

Data Example: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/tc001_data.txt

Generated Code: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/foo.py


STOCK MARKET
------------
Python 1000, Python 2000, and Python 3000 students who are participating in our Stock Market resume-builder will want 
to look at the NASDAQ database generator.

Selecting Data: https://github.com/soft9000/PyDAO/blob/master/SqltDAO/DaoTest01/GenNasdaqTest.py

While that stock exchange's official pipe-delimited ("enpiped" ;) data file is incuded for demonstrative
purposes, note that the most recent set of enpiped data tokens can be downloaded from the stock exchange.
